## Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! We welcome contributions from everyone, whether it's a typo fix or a new feature. Before getting started, please take a moment to review the following guidelines.

## Getting Started

0. To contribute, first fork the repository and clone it to your local machine.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:CatHuyuH24/KHK_Superstore.git
```

1. To install project dependencies, run:

```bash
npm install
```

2. To build the TailwindCSS, run:

```bash
npm run build:css
```

3. To run the migration scripts:

```bash
npm run migrate:dev
```

4. To run the seeding scripts:

```bash
npm run seed:dev
```

<strong>Or you can run both the migration and seeding script with:</strong>

```bash
npm run setup-db:dev
```

5. After the database has been set up, to start the website locally for development, run:

```bash
npm run start-server:dev
```

<strong>Or you can combine step 3, 4 and 5 by running only:</strong>

```bash
npm run dev
```

6. `nodemon` is not necessary for production, so when releasing the platform, we can just run:

```bash
npm start
```
